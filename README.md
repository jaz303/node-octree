# octree## What is an octree?An octree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactlyeight children. Octrees are most often used to partition a three dimensionalspace by recursively subdividing it into eight octants. Octrees are thethree-dimensional analog of quadtrees. The name is formed from oct + tree, butnote that it is normally written "octree" with only one "t". Octrees are oftenused in 3D graphics and 3D game engines.You can read more about it at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octree .## What is octree?octree is a Javascript library that implements octrees. With it, you'll beable to create, modify and browse to an octree.### Usage	var inspect = require('util').inspect;	var octree = require('octree'); // library load	var mytree = octree();    		mytree.insert(0,0,0,"center");  // insert object (in this case a string) on coordinates 0,0,0 (x,y,z)	mytree.insert(-1,0,0,"west");   	mytree.insert(1,0,0,"east");    	mytree.insert(1,3,4,"somewhere");    	mytree.insert(2,3,4,"somewhere");    	mytree.insert(3,3,4,"somewhere");    	mytree.insert(4,3,4,"somewhere");    	mytree.insert(1,4,4,"somewhere");    	mytree.insert(2,4,4,"somewhere");    	mytree.insert(3,4,4,"somewhere");    	mytree.insert(-100,-100,-100,"far away");    	console.log(inspect(mytree, {colors: true, depth: null})); // let's see our octree...
